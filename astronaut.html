    <h2>Astronaut story</h2>
    <p>In Houston for my first time, I had a chance to visit <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/johnson/">NASA’s Johnson Space Center</a>. Overall it was pretty cool, for example, very large old rocket:</p>
    <img src="/static/saturnv.jpg">
    <p>But the coolest part <em>by far</em> was a real live astronaut giving a talk: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Lee_Fisher">Dr. Fisher</a> of this mission patch</p>
    <img src="/static/fisherpatch.png">
    <p>See the two little objects in space with trails behind them? Apparently two satellites had some failure rendering them unusable but not destroyed. So there were these two extremely expensive pieces of metal just floating around space.</p>
    <p>As a result, Dr. Fisher's mission was motivated by the insurance underwriters, who wanted to recover the two lost (again, <em>extremely expensive</em>) satellites. It was funny to hear her go through her whole life story, then suddenly explain how she ended flying to space when insurance came up with this salvage mission.</p>
    <p>Dr. Fisher operated a giant robotic arm called, in a very subtle nod to Canadian involvement, the CANADARM. Astronauts Joe Allen and Dale Gardner performed an untethered spacewalk, and held up a humorous "For Sale" sign next to a satellite.</p>
    <img src="/static/forsale.jpg">
    <p>They successfully brought the satellites into the shuttle cargo bay and returned them to earth. Dr. Fisher's many honors include <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/fisher_anna.pdf">"Lloyd’s of London Silver Medal for Meritorious Salvage Operations"</a>.
